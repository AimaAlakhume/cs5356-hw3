                                I grew up in Lagos, Nigeria, and pursued a Bachelor‚Äôs in Electrical Engineering at NYU.
                                My goals at Cornell Tech are to deepen my knowledge in user-centered
                                design and build immersive, sustainable experiences.

                                üë©üèæ‚Äçüíª I'm passionate about leveraging technology to craft engaging experiences that entertain,
                                educate, and inspire. With a diverse background encompassing electrical engineering,
                                full-stack development, and a forthcoming dual Master's degree from Cornell Tech (specializing
                                in Information Systems and Connective Media), I possess the technical skills and creative vision
                                to bring unique ideas to life.

                                üåç My experience spans a variety of projects, from enhancing Google Search with educational
                                features to leading the development of a mobile app promoting global health initiatives.
                                I've also spearheaded the creation of an augmented reality game, EcoTails, designed to incentivize
                                sustainable practices through immersive gameplay.

                <h4>Using a New HTML Element & CSS Property</h4>

                    <summary>HTML Element Write-Up</summary>
                    <p>
                        I experimented with the details tag for this assignment. I had never
                        heard of it before, and learned that it is an interactive widget that
                        users can toggle open and clsoed. The summary tag inside contains the
                        content visible to users at all times, while the paragraph tag that
                        comes afterward features the hidden content that users have to toggle
                        to see.

                    <summary>CSS Property Write-Up</summary>
                    <p>
                        I implemented the CSS transition property because, although we haven't
                        discussed it in detail in class, I am familiar with it and found it easy
                        to imple,emt. It creates smooth animated effects that add some energy to
                        the webpage. I applied it to my headshot and the links in my navigation
                        bar so they would slowly increase in size and change in color when hovered
                        over by the user. One thing I re-learned is that transitions require
                        specifying whihc property is being animated (e.g. 'color', 'background-color',
                        'transform', etc), a duration and a timin function (such as 'ease-in' or
                        'ease-out'). This property provides subtle visual feedback to the user
                        without making jarring changes.
