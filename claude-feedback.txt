Let me analyze the requirements from the homework assignment against your current implementation:

Missing Regular Requirements:
1. (2.5 points) There's no implementation of fetching data from an API yet
2. (2 points) I don't see usage of an HTML element that wasn't discussed in class (you need to pick one from MDN and write about what you learned)
3. (1 point) I don't see usage of a new CSS property that wasn't discussed in class (you need to pick one from MDN and write about what you learned)

Missing Extra Credit Opportunities (up to +3 points total):
1. (1 point EC) No additional interactivity beyond what CSS :hover could achieve
2. (1 point EC) No meta elements for link previews
3. (1 point EC) No browser-side javascript analytics tracking

Your site has successfully implemented:
- GitHub Pages deployment (it's accessible at the URL)
- Repository creation and usage
- Required content (photo and bio)
- Semantic HTML tags (header, nav, main, section, aside)
- Responsive layout using CSS Flexbox
- Clean HTML and CSS structure

To get full points, I'd recommend:
1. Add an API call to fetch and display some data (this could be something simple like a random quote or joke)
2. Try out a new HTML element (like `<details>`, `<dialog>`, or `<video>`) and document what you learned
3. Experiment with a new CSS property (like transitions, transforms, or filters) and document what you learned

For extra credit, you could:
1. Add some JavaScript-based interactivity (like a mousemove event handler that does something interesting)
2. Add meta tags for link previews
3. Implement analytics using something like GoatCounter

Would you like me to provide a more detailed example of how to implement any of these missing requirements?
